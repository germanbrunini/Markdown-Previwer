# Markdown-Previwer
FreeCodeCamp - Front End Development Curriculum.
This a "html" that fullfills all requirements to pass [FCC MarkdownPreview assignment](https://germanbrunini.github.io/Markdown-Previwer/). Remember that only 6 item are mandatory. Item 7 is optional and this "html" does not pass it. Nevermind!
